## Neuronal Network Analysis

* last: 18/6/2020
* reconstruct network from dynamics (time series data) of nodes
* replicate neuronal dynamics from model

## Project 1 - toy model

* paper: Extracting connectivity from dynamics of networks with uniform bidirectional coupling (2013)
* recover network connectivity (adjacency matrix) from time series data of a known random network
* nodes obey consensus dynamics

## Project 2a - (FYP Prelim) simulated dynamics

* paper: Reconstructing links in directed networks from noisy dynamics (2017)
* simulate dynamics based on eq[1]
* intrinsic dynamics (dynamics on its own): eq[10]
* coupling function (interaction between nodes): eq[12]
* experimental observation of neurons:
    - non-uniform spiking
    - some larger activity, some smaller
* goal: replicate neuronal dynamics with model-estimated links and weights
